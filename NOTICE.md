# IMPORTANT

If you modify any of the item textures, please do so in the aseprite file format and then export it. If you don't have access to aseprite (your issue, you can just self-compile it) then send the changes to some active maintainer, and he will help you out :3

This is so the animated textures are in the correct format.

Thanks
